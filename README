Showcase, Simple display case for images. 
==========================================

Showcase is a simple image display case for images. It can be used for many things, we at DigitPaint
use it to quickly put up series of website mockup images to show to our clients. Some of our designer friends 
use it to present rough sketches of their work to their clients. 

Showcase isn't fancy but it:
* Does not require serverside scripting (so you can just FTP it to your favorite host and it works)
* Is very lightweight (packed with YUI Compressor it's about 30kB)
* Degrades nicely on older browsers (even your aunt with her 486 PC and Internet Explorer 4 
  can see the images (not tested though))
* Is very easy to set up even without a lot HTML knowledge
* It's very customizable (see the stylesheet and just hack away)

Get started
===========
Currently only tested on OS X 10.4, requires rake. A pre-built package will be available
for download later on.

1. Clone this repository to your local computer
2. (Optional) Download YUI Compressor 2.5.3 from http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/ and put
   the yuicompressor-2.3.5.jar in the vendor directory
3. Type "rake build"
4. Open build/index.html with your browser to see the sample showcase
5. Add images to build/images and insert them into index.html (Just leave the ids on the H1 and the DIV)
6. Upload to your favorite host

Known issues
============

* Showcase doesn't show the images in Internet Explorer if the images aren't on a webserver. Once they're
  uploaded and accessed through a webserver they should be fine.
